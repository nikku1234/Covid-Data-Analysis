Pharmacy Services and the Novel Coronavirus [Chemotherapy strategy for colorectal cancer under the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019],"Alderman, C.; Li, Y. H.; Shen, L.; Li, J.","Pharmacists around the world can expect to be affected by the coronavirus, especially those who provide care for older people who are at a much higher risk for grave consequences from the virus. It is critical that pharmacists maintain awareness of the evolving pandemic and access reliable information to remain familiar with developments. The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) makes the medical treatment of colorectal cancers difficult. Cancer patients are more susceptible to infection and tumor history is defined as an important factor of poor prognosis, which challenges both doctors and patients. For metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, maintenance therapy is the optimal choice. The patients with tumor progression or poor biological behavior should receive or continue combination chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy should reduce the intensity of treatment and shorten the therapy time. Fever patients during chemotherapy need to receive differential diagnosis and screening according to national standards. Patients with stable diseases and good general conditions may delay imaging examination. Clinicians should make individual clinical decisions based on the specifics of each patient during epidemic situation.",2020,,The Senior care pharmacist Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery,35,4,146-147,32192297,10.4140/TCP.n.2020.146. 10.3760/cma.j.cn.441530-20200225-00089,13430,#12117,Alderman 2020,,"* Narrative review; * Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Infection prevention and control",24-03-20

How to link patients with suspicious COVID-19 to health system from the community pharmacies? A route proposal,"Amariles, Pedro; Ledezma-Morales, Mónica; Salazar-Ospina, Andrea; Hincapié-García, Jaime Alejandro","Colombia confirmed its first case of the COVID-19 on March 6th, 2020. On March 16th, 2020, 54 cases have been confirmed (36 imported and 18 associated), therefore, Colombia is at highest alert, and it is now trying to avoid or minimize the last stage of “community transmission”. We present a route proposal that shows how the community pharmacist may develop his responsibility to contribute to the early detection and appropriate referral of possible cases of the COVID-19. In the route have been considered three possible entrances depending on the needs of the users: anti-flu drugs, symptoms related to COVID-19 infection or the request for items for hygiene and prevention of transmission such as alcohol and face masks. Later, self-care education should be given, and the possible cases should be reported to the telephone lines designated by the mayor or the governor, continuing the healthcare process. Community pharmacies and pharmacy staff play a crucial role in minimizing the stage of “community transmission” of COVID-19, through properly detection and management of possible cases and customer education.",2020,,Research in Social and Administrative Pharmacy,,,,,10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.007,12494,#11970,Amariles 2020,,"Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Ethics, social science, economics; Infection prevention and control",24-03-20
CT Manifestations of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia: A Case Report [Treatment strategy for gastrointestinal tumor under the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China],"An, P.; Song, P.; Lian, K.; Wang, Y.; Chen, Y. H.; Peng, J. S.","BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has impacted nearly >90,000 people in more than 75 countries. In this case report, we aim to define the chest computed tomography findings of 2019-novel coronavirus associated with pneumonia and its successful resolution after treatment. CASE REPORT: A fifty-year-old female patient, who is a businesswoman, presented with chief complaints of “fever for one week, diarrhea, anorexia, and asthenia.” Initially, she was given Tamiflu. The influenza A virus serology was negative. Three days later, levofloxacin was started because the patient’s symptoms did not improve. The novel coronavirus nucleic acid test was negative. It was noted that before the onset of the disease, the patient went to Wuhan on a business trip. Despite the given treatment, her body temperature rose to 39.2°C and she was referred to our clinic for further evaluation. Then, chest computed tomography was performed and showed bilateral multifocal ground glass opacities with consolidation which suggested viral pneumonia as a differential diagnosis, and the subsequent 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia nucleic acid test was positive. CONCLUSION: Chest computed tomography offers fast and convenient evaluation of patients with suspected 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has become a public health emergency in China. Chinese authorities and health agencies had devoted great efforts to control this disease. As surgeons specialized in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors, we should always be aware of the prevention for NCP and incorporate this awareness into every detail of clinical practice. For the patients with gastrointestinal tumors, pre-admission screening should be done in order to rule out NCP. Real-time RT-PCR panel and chest CT scan should be conducted for patients with fever (>37.3℃), travel history to Hubei Province within 14 days, or contact history with residents from Wuhan district within 14 days. Prevention measures for both medical staffs and the screen-negative admitted patients should also be enhanced because false negative is possible. Medical instruments should be properly discarded or disinfected according to standardized procedures established by the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC). Surgical operation should be reduced at a minimal level to prevent cross infection in this special period.Surgical intervention for benign tumor should be postponed. For malignant tumor, multidisciplinary therapy (MDT) is recommended and non-surgical anti-tumor therapy should be selected with higher priority. Neoadjuvant therapy is highly recommended for gastrointestinal cancer at advanced stages that meet the indications of NCCN guideline (gastric cancer T stage ≥ 2/rectal cancer T stage ≥ 3/unresectable colon cancer). Gastric or esophagogastricjunction (EGJ) malignant tumor with obstruction can be managed with gastric tube decompression or stent placement to relieve the symptoms. Transnasal enteral feeding tube intubation/percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy could be adopted to ensure enteral nutrition supply. For colorectal malignancy with simple intestinal obstruction, stent placement can achieve a high success rate, which not only helps avoid emergency surgery, but also creates a better condition for subsequent surgery. Transcatheter arterial embolization for hemostasis is an alternative choice for gastrointestinal tumor with bleeding. However, emergency operation still must be performed for patients with acute uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or after other alternative treatment measures fail. All cases with suspicious or confirmed with NCP must be reported to the local CDC department. All invasive intervention must be performed in a designated isolation area. Tertiary prevention measure must be adopted for all anesthetists with additional face mask or medical goggle protection to prevent respiratory droplet transmission. Preventive enterostomy is preferable in lower digestive tract surgery. Thoroughly disinfecting the operating room after surgery is necessary. Fever after surgery must be carefully differentiated whether it's caused by post-surgery abdominal infection/inflammation or NCP. Single-room isolation and related examinations should be performed according to the standard procedures. We believe that with the unprecedentedly joint efforts of doctors and patients, we will eventually win this war against NCP.",2020,,Balkan medical journal Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery,23,2,I-iv,32074786,10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2020.2020.2.15 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1671-0274.2020.02.001,13117,#12128,An 2020,,"* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment",24-03-20

Y.","Endotracheal intubation is an independent risk factor for respiratory infectious diseases. We conducted a retrospective study in 12 cases with COVID-19 who underwent endotracheal intubation at ICU of the Guangzhou eighth hospital from January 20 to February 10, 2020. The intubation procedure, anesthetic regimen, and complication were collected and analyzed. The 9 healthcare workers who involved in intubation received virus nucleic acid test and 14 days temperature monitoring. All 12 patients were successfully intubated under the guidance of bronchoscope, without any complications. Midazolam, Propofol and Morphine or fentanyl were used for sedation and analgesia, avoiding patients cough and agitated during the procedure. The 9 healthcare workers were protected under the Personal Protective Equipment(PPE) with positive pressure protective hood. The detection of oropharyngeal swab virus nucleic acid were negative in all 9 healthcare workers, none of them had fever or any respiratory symptoms. The PPE with positive pressure protective hood should be needed to perform bronchoscope-guided endotracheal intubation in patients with COVID-19, it could strengthen to protect healthcare workers from virus exposure. Since December 2019, a cluster of patients have been diagnosed to be infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China. The epidemic has been spreading to other areas of the country and abroad. A few cases have progressed rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome and/or multiple organ function failure. The epidemiological survey has indicated that the general population is susceptible to 2019-nCoV. A total of 14 children (6 months to 14 years of age, including 5 cases in Wuhan) have been confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV in China so far.

[Recommendations on the clinical management of the COVID-19 infection by the «new coronavirus» SARS-CoV2. Spanish Paediatric Association working group] A tug-of-war between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and host antiviral defence: lessons from other pathogenic viruses,"Calvo, C.; García López-Hortelano, M.; de Carlos Vicente, J. C.; Vázquez Martínez, J. L.; Fung, S. Y.; Yuen, K. S.; Ye, Z. W.; Chan, C. P.; Jin, D. Y.","On 31 December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of Health and Healthcare (Hubei Province, China) reported that there were 27 cases of pneumonia of unknown origin with symptoms starting on the 8 December. There were 7 serious cases with common exposure in market with shellfish, fish, and live animals, in the city of Wuhan. On 7 January 2020, the Chinese authorities identified that the agent causing the outbreak was a new type of virus of the Coronaviridae family, temporarily called «new coronavirus», 2019-nCoV. On January 30th, 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the outbreak an International Emergency. On 11 February 2020 the WHO assigned it the name of SARS-CoV2 and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2 and COVID-19). The Ministry of Health summoned the Specialties Societies to prepare a clinical protocol for the management of COVID-19. The Spanish Paediatric Association appointed a Working Group of the Societies of Paediatric Infectious Diseases and Paediatric Intensive Care to prepare the present recommendations with the evidence available at the time of preparing them. World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Human infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe. The severe cases present with pneumonia, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just crossed species barrier to infect humans. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely determined by virus-host interaction. Here, we review the discovery, zoonotic origin, animal hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to its interplay with host antiviral defense. A comparison with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired human coronaviruses and other pathogenic viruses including human immunodeficiency viruses is made. We summarize current understanding of the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes. Important questions concerning the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host antiviral defence, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, are also discussed.",2020,,"Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003) Emerging microbes & infections",9,1,558-570,32172672,10.1016/j.anpedi.2020.02.001 10.1080/22221751.2020.1736644,13495,#12220,Calvo 2020,,"* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Virology, immunology",24-03-20
"Features, Evaluation and Treatment Coronavirus (COVID-19) Discussing the ABCs of Health Security-Antibiotic Resistance, Biothreats, and Coronavirus","Cascella, M.; Rajnik, M.; Cuomo, A.; Dulebohn, S. C.; Di Napoli, R.; Desai, A. N.","According to the World Health Organization (WHO), viral diseases continue to emerge and represent a serious issue to public health. In the last twenty years, several viral epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003, and H1N1 influenza in 2009, have been recorded. Most recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In a timeline that reaches the present day, an epidemic of cases with unexplained low respiratory infections detected in Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area in China's Hubei province, was first reported to the WHO Country Office in China, on December 31, 2019. Published literature can trace the beginning of symptomatic individuals back to the beginning of December 2019. As they were unable to identify the causative agent, these first cases were classified as ""pneumonia of unknown etiology."" The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local CDCs organized an intensive outbreak investigation program. The etiology of this illness is now attributed to a novel virus belonging to the coronavirus (CoV) family, COVID-19. On February 11, 2020, the WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced that the disease caused by this new CoV was a ""COVID-19,"" which is the acronym of ""coronavirus disease 2019"". In the past twenty years, two additional coronavirus epidemics have occurred. SARS-CoV provoked a large-scale epidemic beginning in China and involving two dozen countries with approximately 8000 cases and 800 deaths, and the MERS-CoV that began in Saudi Arabia and has approximately 2,500 cases and 800 deaths and still causes as sporadic cases. This new virus seems to be very contagious and has quickly spread globally. In a meeting on January 30, 2020, per the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), the outbreak was declared by the WHO a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries with four countries reporting human-to-human transmission. An additional landmark occurred on February 26, 2020, as the first case of the disease, not imported from China, was recorded in the United States.  Initially, the new virus was called 2019-nCoV. Subsequently, the task of experts of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) termed it the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it is very similar to the one that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoVs). The CoVs have become the major pathogens of emerging respiratory disease outbreaks. They are a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal species. For reasons yet to be explained, these viruses can cross species barriers and can cause, in humans, illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS. Interestingly, these latter viruses have probably originated from bats and then moving into other mammalian hosts — the Himalayan palm civet for SARS-CoV, and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV — before jumping to humans. The dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 are currently unknown, but there is speculation that it also has an animal origin. The potential for these viruses to grow to become a pandemic worldwide seems to be a serious public health risk. Concerning COVID-19, the WHO raised the threat to the CoV epidemic to the ""very high"" level, on February 28, 2020. Probably, the effects of the epidemic caused by the new CoV has yet to emerge as the situation is quickly evolving. World governments are at work to establish countermeasures to stem possible devastating effects. Health organizations coordinate information flows and issues directives and guidelines to best mitigate the impact of the threat. At the same time, scientists around the world work tirelessly, and information about the transmission mechanisms, the clinical spectrum of disease, new diagnostics, and prevention and therapeutic strategies are rapidly developing. Many uncertainties remain with regard to both the virus-host interaction and the evolution of the epidemic, with specific reference to the times when the epidemic will reach its peak. At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are only supportive, and prevention aimed at reducing transmission in the community is our best weapon. Aggressive isolation measures in China have led to a progressive reduction of cases in the last few days. In Italy, in geographic regions of the north of the peninsula, political and health authorities are making incredible efforts to contain a shock wave that is severely testing the health system.  In the midst of the crisis, the authors have chosen to use the ""Statpearls"" platform because, within the PubMed scenario, it represents a unique tool that may allow them to make updates in real-time. The aim, therefore, is to collect information and scientific evidence and to provide an overview of the topic that will be continuously updated.",2020,,StatPearls,,,,32150360,10.1001/jama.2019.21022,13347,#12230,Cascella 2020,,"* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Epidemiology; Infection prevention and control; Reservoir; Virology, immunology",24-03-20

Induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and IL-6) and lung inflammation by Coronavirus-19 (COVI-19 or SARS-CoV-2): anti-inflammatory strategies,"Conti, P.; Ronconi, G.; Caraffa, A.; Gallenga, C. E.; Ross, R.; Frydas, I.; Kritas, S. K.","Coronavirus-19 (COVI-19) involves humans as well as animals and may cause serious damage to the respiratory tract, including the lung: coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This pathogenic virus has been identified in swabs performed on the throat and nose of patients who suffer from or are suspected of the disease. When COVI-19 infect the upper and lower respiratory tract it can cause mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6. The binding of COVI-19 to the Toll Like Receptor (TLR) causes the release of pro-IL-1β which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature IL-1β which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis. Suppression of pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members and IL-6 have been shown to have a therapeutic effect in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections. Cytokine IL-37 has the ability to suppress innate and acquired immune response and also has the capacity to inhibit inflammation by acting on IL-18Rα receptor. IL-37 performs its immunosuppressive activity by acting on mTOR and increasing the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) kinase. This cytokine inhibits class II histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and inflammation in inflammatory diseases by suppressing MyD88 and subsequently IL-1β, IL-6, TNF and CCL2. The suppression of IL-1β by IL-37 in inflammatory state induced by coronavirus-19 can have a new therapeutic effect previously unknown. Another inhibitory cytokine is IL-38, the newest cytokine of the IL-1 family members, produced by several immune cells including B cells and macrophages. IL-38 is also a suppressor cytokine which inhibits IL-1β and other pro-inflammatory IL-family members. IL-38 is a potential therapeutic cytokine which inhibits inflammation in viral infections including that caused by coronavirus-19, providing a new relevant strategy.",2020,,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,34,2,,32171193,10.23812/conti-e.,14259,#12313,Conti 2020,,"Virology, immunology",24-03-20

The international imperative to rapidly and inexpensively monitor community-wide Covid-19 infection status and trends,"Daughton, Christian","Given the continuing concerns surrounding the lack of adequate diagnostic testing for Covid-19 (caused by SARS-CoV-2), even less attention is being paid to what could become an even more urgent need - - the ability to quickly determine the status and trends of Covid-19 within and across communities nationwide. The existing Covid-19 clinical diagnostic tests will prove woefully inadequate for rapidly monitoring (at comparatively low cost) the incidence of Covid-19 community-wide. It is simply not feasible to do repeated individual testing at very large scales. Rapid community-wide monitoring could prove of immense international importance in quickly determining trends in whether the spread of Covid-19 (as well as future viral epidemics) in individual communities is increasing or decreasing. This ability is critical for better informing containment and mitigation strategies as well as for better-targeting followup diagnostic testing of individuals. This would prove even more important if SARS-CoV-2 reinfections and episodic outbreaks begin to widely occur. Fortunately, the relatively new field of sewage epidemiology (also called wastewater-based epidemiology: WBE) has been advancing steadily over the last 15 years (for example, see Choi et al, 2018; Daughton 2018), with research efforts largely concentrated in Europe. Originally geared toward determining the population-wide use of illicit drugs, this monitoring concept has since evolved to include a broad array of other types of substances in wastewater, including virus particles. So the time required for developing and implementing a wastewater monitoring approach specifically designed for SARS-CoV-2 (and Covid-19) might be greatly reduced. It is critical that governments worldwide be made aware of the important role that sewage epidemiology could play in controlling the spread of Covid-19. National agencies should encourage the development of sewage monitoring capabilities. This can be done partly by soliciting and funding grant proposals; one such example is a call for research proposals dealing with many aspects of coronavirus by the Swiss National Science Foundation (http://www.snf.ch/en/funding/programmes/coronavirus/Pages/default.aspx). Future calls for proposals focused solely on WBE might be more productive. One problem is the very uneven worldwide distribution of not just R&D on WBE, but also the uneven adoption of WBE for existing purposes such as community-wide illicit drug monitoring. Some countries, such as the U.S., have little experience with the implementation of WBE. For this reason, it will be important to encourage international research collaborations. This would be the best way to ensure adoption of WBE worldwide for monitoring pandemics. Development of a rapid and economical WBE tool for monitoring status and trends of Covid-19 mass infection will encounter a number of challenges, many of which are often shared by existing WBE methods for other targets of analysis (such as chemical micropollutants). Challenges include statistically representative sampling of sewage, Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proofwhich is heterogeneous. With respect to its occurrence in sewage, viable SARS-CoV-2 probably enters mainly via shedding in the stool. Non-viable virus (and associate viral debris such as RNA fragments, mRNA, or capsid subunits) could enter sewage via stool and urine. Virus particle loadings in sewage can be quantified by targeting virus functional or structural motifs. Since the half-life of viable SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater seems to be very short, any detection method should account for both viable and non-viable particles. Degradation products (such as RNA fragments) from the virus could also be selected as targets. Detection approaches could include RT-PCR (or allied approaches) and ELISA, coupled with the Most Probable Number (MPN) method for quantifying sewage loadings of combined viable and non-viable virus particles. For each individual sewage treatment plant (STP), the virus loading levels would then be directly used to establish status and time trends. The levels could also be normalized against the populations served by each STP plant in order to rank communities with respect to their community-wide infection rates. This would facilitate rapid identification of hot spots for better-informed intervention measures and prevention of emerging clusters.",2020,,Science of The Total Environment,,,138149-138149,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138149,12495,#11652,Daughton 2020,,* Narrative review; * Opinion piece; Epidemiology,24-03-20
Eco-Virological Preliminary Study of Potentially Emerging Pathogens in Hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) Recovered at a Wildlife Treatment and Rehabilitation Center in Northern Italy,"Delogu, M.; Cotti, C.; Lelli, D.; Sozzi, E.; Trogu, T.; Lavazza, A.; Garuti, G.; Castrucci, M. R.; Vaccari, G.; De Marco, M. A.; Moreno, A.","The Western European Hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) is one of the four hedgehog species belonging to the genus Erinaceus. Among them, E. amurensis is extant in East Asia's areas only, whereas E. europaeus, E. roumanicus and E. concolor are mainly found in Europe. E. europaeus is endemically distributed from western to central and southern Europe, including Italy. Western European hedgehogs' ecological and feeding habits, along with their high population densities, notable synanthropic attitudes, frequent contacts with sympatric wild and domestic species, including humans, implicate the possible involvement of E. europaeus in the ecology of potentially emerging viruses, such as coronaviruses, influenza A and influenza D viruses, canine distemper virus, pestiviruses and Aujeszky's disease virus. We examined 24 E. europaeus individuals found injured in urban and rural areas of Northern Italy. Of the 24 fecal samples collected and tested for the above-mentioned pathogens by both PCR-based and virus isolation methods, 14 were found PCR-positive for betacoronaviruses belonging to lineage C and related to the known Erinaceus coronaviruses (EriCoVs), as determined by partial sequencing of the virus genome. Our findings suggest that hedgehogs could be considered natural reservoirs of CoVs, and also act as chronic shedding carriers of these potentially emerging RNA viruses.",2020,,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,10,3,,32121543,10.3390/ani10030407,14041,#12341,Delogu 2020,,Other related diseases and viruses; Reservoir,24-03-20

H.; Gao, L.; Li, X. Y.; Zhang, Y.; Israeli, E.","Objective: To investigate the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of 135 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Tianjin. Methods: The clinical and epidemiological data of 135 cases of COVID-19 in Tianjin were collected, and the data were analyzed with descriptive method. The factors influencing the severity of the illness were analyzed. Results: Among the 135 COVID-19 cases, 72 were males and 63 were females, the age of the cases was (48.62±16.83) years, and the case fatality rate was 2.22%. Local transmission caused 74.81% of the cases. A total of 33 clusters occurred, involving 85.92% of all COVID-19 cases. The median of the incubation period of COVID-19 was 6.50 days, the average generation interval was 5 days, and the household secondary transmission rate was 20.46%. Fever was the main symptom (78.63%), followed by cough (56.48%). Multivariate regression analysis indicated that age (OR=1.038, 95%CI: 1.010-1.167) and the number of chronic underlying diseases (OR=1.709, 95%CI: 1.052-2.777) were the risk factors of severe illness. Conclusions: Fever was the main symptom at the early phase of COVID-19 in Tianjin, and the local cluster cases accounted for high proportion in confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Tianjin. Severe illness was prone to occur in people with old age and multi underlying diseases.

A.","Objective: To explore imaging characteristics of children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data and chest CT images of 15 children diagnosed with 2019-nCoV. They were admitted to the third people's Hospital of Shenzhen from January 16 to February 6, 2020. The distribution and morphology of pulmonary lesions on chest CT images were analyzed. Results: Among the 15 children, there were 5 males and 10 females, aged from 4 to 14 years old. Five of the 15 children were febrile and 10 were asymptomatic on first visit. The first nasal or pharyngeal swab samples in all the 15 cases were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. For their first chest CT images, 6 patients had no lesions, while 9 patients had pulmonary inflammation lesions. Seven cases of small nodular ground glass opacities and 2 cases of speckled ground glass opacities were found. After 3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in a second respiratory sample turned negative in 6 cases. Among them, chest CT images showed less lesions in 2 cases, no lesion in 3 cases, and no improvement in 1 case. Other 9 cases were still positive in a second nucleic acid test. Six patients showed similar chest CT inflammation, while 3 patients had new lesions, which were all small nodular ground glass opacities. Conclusions: The early chest CT images of children with 2019-nCoV infection are mostly small nodular ground glass opacities. The clinical symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific. Dynamic reexamination of chest CT and nucleic acid are important.

The countries getting it right,"Hamzelou, Jessica","The world can learn lessons from how China, South Korea and Singapore have handled covid-19, the WHO's Bruce Aylward tells Jessica Hamzelou Previous article in issueNext article in issue LAST month, the World Health Organization's assistant director general Bruce Aylward set out to learn more about China's response to the covid-19 outbreak and generate recommendations for China and other countries. He told Jessica Hamzelou what we have learned so far. Jessica Hamzelou: Cases in China are declining – we are now only seeing a handful of new reported cases every day. Does China have the virus under control? Bruce Aylward: It has absolutely turned it around. [But] governors, mayors and others that I talked to in China would never say things were “under control”. When I asked them if they felt good about falling cases, they said no. They said they were building more beds and buying more ventilators because they were worried that they might never get something like this – a new virus that we don't understand – under control. Now they are planning to open up all the travel restrictions, get people back to work and get students back to school. But their feeling was that this is going to remain in the population and raise its ugly head, and they have to be able to respond rapidly. How did China get to this point? China did something that most other countries would not even have tried, and many people thought would have been impossible. It used fundamental public health approaches – such as case finding and contact tracing – to stop a respiratory virus. That seemed almost impossible as a premise because respiratory viruses transmit so effectively and efficiently – typically the only way you can stop them is with a vaccine or pharmaceutical treatment. What China did provides a lesson for infectious disease epidemiologists. Does that mean China's extreme lockdowns were the right way to go? Everyone always starts at the wrong end of the China response. The first thing it did was try to prevent the spread as much as it could, and make sure people knew about the disease and how to get tested. To actually stop the virus, it had to do rapid testing of any suspect case, immediate isolation of anyone who was a confirmed or suspected case, and then quarantine the close contacts for 14 days so that they could figure out if any were infected. Those were the measures that stopped transmission in China, not the big travel restrictions and lockdowns. 14% Roughly how many people in South Korea are 65 or older Stopping the movement of people doesn't stop the virus jumping from person to person, it just prevents those people from moving to other places. The travel restrictions and lockdowns were to give them time to get the other things in place and actually stop transmission. When I spoke to Italy the other day, they said: “We've got these lockdowns in place.” I said: “Great, you've done the hard part, now you have to do the really hard part, and that is making sure the cases are effectively isolated.” Italy is the most affected country in Europe. What's happening there? What's happening in Italy, and in many other countries in Europe, is that they are treating the mild cases at home. In some countries they are not even testing them. They are saying if you have a cough and high fever, stay at home. But the problem then is that [people] don't know that they have the disease, they haven't had it confirmed. After a couple of days people get bored, go out for a walk and go shopping and get other people infected. If you know you are infected you are more likely to isolate yourself. Generally in a population, around 60 to 80 per cent of those affected are going to have mild or moderate disease. If those people are all out of hospital, most of your cases are at home, but not isolated. In China, they found that didn't work. They had to get them isolated in hospitals or dormitories or stadiums. The main goal was to keep them from getting bored. Which countries have responded well to the outbreak? There are lots. Look at South Korea – it has been pretty rigorous about testing all the suspect cases and finding all the contacts. In the past couple of days, we have seen that, instead of that relentless upward creep in cases, it seems to have turned a corner, which is positive. Singapore is another country that has been hit with importations again and again, and they are jumping on them, tracing all the cases, tracing all the contacts, professionally isolating them all. It seems to be doing pretty well, even though it has got relatively big numbers. Canada had importations into four or five different provinces. And in almost all of those it has been able to keep the numbers fairly low, following a very similar rapid test approach. And in all those places, it's very easy to get tested as well. Do you think these countries have learned lessons from other, past outbreaks? Oh absolutely. When you look at Singapore, South Korea, China – why are they so aggressive in terms of case finding and contact tracing for coronavirus? Well they were all hit by SARS. Similarly, if you look at Canada, it had a big SARS outbreak back in 2003, with hundreds of cases. [These countries] saw the devastation a coronavirus can cause – they jumped right on it. Why has the case fatality rate been lower in South Korea than in other countries? It has a relatively young population. The population aged over 65 in South Korea is something like 14 per cent – half that of Japan and much lower than Italy. A case fatality rate of around 1 per cent – close to what we are seeing in South Korea now – is what we see in a young population. But the case fatality rate has been creeping up over time. The thing that I would remember, even right now in South Korea, is that [the fatality rate] is still tenfold higher than seasonal flu. Is that why it has been so bad in Italy, because the population is older? We are not sure. I saw some data from the north [of Italy] that suggests around one-third of cases are being managed at home. Some of the milder cases just aren't being tested and officially diagnosed. That's part of the problem. The second is the older population. The third is it is also very early in their outbreak, and that can sometimes be where you see higher mortality among older people, and it distorts the picture. What do you think of the UK, which hasn't been taking as strong measures as some countries? People have different reasons for taking different measures at different times in an outbreak. Chris [Whitty, chief medical adviser to the UK] is one of the brightest, most sensible and careful people I know. I'm not going to second-guess anybody at this time. How effective is closing schools? That's a tough one. The data [on this is] for a different disease – it's for flu. Kids get these rip-roaring flus, and the whole classroom gets sick. The kids get their families infected. Parents have to stay at home with the kids, and then they get sick, go to work and infect others. But one of the curious things with [covid-19] is that we have not seen school outbreaks. I talked to my colleagues in South Korea, in China, in Italy, everywhere – no one has seen school outbreaks. They have seen situations where a teacher is infected and they have infected kids, but that is different to the kids all getting each other infected. When you talk about school closures, you want to know, is it going to reduce the intensity of transmission? We know that it probably won't reduce the number of sick people very much, because not many kids get sick. But what we don't know is, are kids getting infected and we just can't see it? And if they are, are they carrying it back to their families? Even there we don't have a lot of data to suggest that kids are infecting their families. So as a result, countries have done things differently. Lockdown is the hard part. Making sure cases are effectively isolated is the really hard part There is a chance that when cases decline in countries and restrictions loosen, we will see more infections. What happens then? China decided that it cannot afford to wait for cases to go to absolute zero – not knowing if they ever will – so it decided to strengthen its whole system so that it could live with the disease if it had to. It is building additional capacity to isolate people, and it is building additional ventilators. It is planning to be able to manage low-level disease and prevent large outbreaks. It's a very sensible way to plan. It's wishful thinking to think that the virus is going to disappear altogether. People keep saying that maybe in the warm season it will.

COVID-19 and Dialysis Units: What Do We Know Now and What Should We Do?,"Ikizler, T. Alp","Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a newly discovered transmissible disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, primarily manifesting as an acute upper and lower respiratory tract illness that may be complicated by interstitial and alveolar pneumonia. It may also affect multiple other tissues such as the heart, digestive tract, kidneys, blood, and nervous system.1 The rapidly spreading outbreak, which first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019 was declared a global pandemic on March 11th, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). The number of individuals affected by the disease increases by the day and there are several resources that provide up-to-date epidemiological data.2 Maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients are at increased risk for COVID-19 and its complications for several reasons. Many MHD patients are of older age and have certain comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, diabetes, and lung disease as well as an underlying immune-compromised state that are associated with worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19.3 The logistical aspects of MHD further increase the risk of disease transmission such as recurrent physical presence at health care facilities and physical proximity of patients during hemodialysis. It is, therefore, crucial to rapidly employ appropriate preventive strategies in outpatient hemodialysis facilities. This summary is aimed at providing up-to-date scientific information about COVID-19 as it relates to MHD patients and highlighting the strategies to minimize its spread in outpatient hemodialysis facilities.[truncated]",2020,,American Journal of Kidney Diseases,,,,,10.1053/j.ajkd.2020.03.008,12500,#11701,Ikizler 2020,,"* Narrative review; * Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Infection prevention and control",24-03-20
2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outbreak and Molecular Genetic Characteristics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2,"Jeong, Yong Seok","The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks that emerged in Wuhan city, Hubei province, have led to a formidable number of confirmed cases that resulted in >5,700 deaths globally, including 143 countries in all 6 continents. The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern with a very high level of global risk assessment. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent of COVID-19, has >79% nucleotide sequence homology to SARS-CoV; therefore, both belong to the genus betacoronavirus and subgenus sarbecovirus. The S1 domains of the two appeared to share the cellular receptor ACE2, but revealed a much higher S1-ACE2 binding affinity. As seen in many other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 also shows respiratory infection, but the basic reproductive number (R₀) in transmission and the clinical latency are quite dissimilar from those of SARS- or MERS-CoVs. Many scientists infer that the time point of cross-barrier transfer from bats to mediate animals or to humans should be a rather recent event based on the full-length genome analyses obtained from the very first patients. Copy-choice polymerization, which often leads to a significant genome recombination rate in most coronaviruses, predicts the continued emergence of novel coronaviruses.",2020,,J Bacteriol Virol,50,1,01-Aug,,10.4167/jbv.2020.50.1.001,14383,#13564,Jeong 2020,,"Epidemiology; Virology, immunology",24-03-20

Early dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study Soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2: a potential approach for coronavirus infection therapy?,"Kucharski, A. J.; Russell, T. W.; Diamond, C.; Liu, Y.; Edmunds, J.; Funk, S.; Eggo, R. M.; Batlle, D.; Wysocki, J.; Satchell, K.","BACKGROUND: An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95 333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced. METHODS: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020. FINDINGS: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number (R(t)) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15-4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41-2·39) 1 week after. Based on our estimates of R(t), assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually. FUNDING: Wellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research. A new coronavirus, referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for the recent outbreak of severe respiratory disease. This outbreak first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has spread to other regions of China and to 25 other countries as of January, 2020. It has been known since the 2003 SARS epidemic that the receptor critical for SARS-CoV entry into host cells is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S1 domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV attaches the virus to its cellular receptor ACE2 on the host cells. We thought that it is timely to explain the connection between the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 and the rationale for soluble ACE2 as a potential therapy.",2020,,"The Lancet.

So far, COVID-19 has affected 84,503 patients in 57 countries/territories and caused 2,924 deaths in nine countries. However, the epidemiology data differ across countries. Although China had higher morbidity and mortality than other sites, the number of new cases per day in China is lesser than that outside of China since February 26, 2020. The incidence ranged from 61.4 per 1,000,000 people in Republic of Korea to 0.0002 per 1,000,000 people in India. The daily cumulative index (DCI) of COVID-19 (cumulative cases/no. of days between the first reported case and February 29, 2020) was greatest in China (1,320.85 per day), followed by Republic of Korea (78.78 per day), Iran (43.11 per day), and Italy (30.62 per day). However, the DCI in other countries/territories were less than 10 per day. Several effective measures including restricting travel from China, controlling the distribution of masks, extensive investigation of COVID-19 spread, and at once daily press conference by government to inform and educate people were aggressively conducted in Taiwan. This is probably the reason why there was only 39 cases (as of February 29, 2020) with a DCI of 1 case per day in Taiwan, which was much lower than that of nearby countries, such as Republic of Korea and Japan.

The neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV2 may play a role in the respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients,"Li, Y. C.; Bai, W. Z.; Hashikawa, T.","Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), another highly pathogenic coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world. This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS-CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID-19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously. Additionally, some patients with COVID-19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases. The infection of SARS-CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected. Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse-connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways. Considering the high similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of SARS-CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID-19. Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure.",2020,,Journal of medical virology,,,,32104907,10.1002/jmv.25728,14328,#12499,Li 2020,,"* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Virology, immunology",24-03-20

"Can Chinese Medicine Be Used for Prevention of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)? A Review of Historical Classics, Research Evidence and Current Prevention Programs Potent binding of 2019 novel coronavirus spike protein by a SARS coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody","Luo, H.; Tang, Q. L.; Shang, Y. X.; Liang, S. B.; Yang, M.; Robinson, N.; Liu, J. P.; Tian, X.; Li, C.; Huang, A.; Xia, S.; Lu, S.; Shi, Z.; Lu, L.; Jiang, S.; Yang, Z.; Wu, Y.; Ying, T.","OBJECTIVE: Since December 2019, an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to almost all parts of China. This was followed by prevention programs recommending Chinese medicine (CM) for the prevention. In order to provide evidence for CM recommendations, we reviewed ancient classics and human studies. METHODS: Historical records on prevention and treatment of infections in CM classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, and CM prevention programs issued by health authorities in China since the COVID-19 outbreak were retrieved from different databases and websites till 12 February, 2020. Research evidence included data from clinical trials, cohort or other population studies using CM for preventing contagious respiratory virus diseases. RESULTS: The use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases was traced back to ancient Chinese practice cited in Huangdi's Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) where preventive effects were recorded. There were 3 studies using CM for prevention of SARS and 4 studies for H1N1 influenza. None of the participants who took CM contracted SARS in the 3 studies. The infection rate of H1N1 influenza in the CM group was significantly lower than the non-CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.52; n=4). For prevention of COVID-19, 23 provinces in China issued CM programs. The main principles of CM use were to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness. The most frequently used herbs included Radix astragali (Huangqi), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao). CONCLUSIONS: Based on historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk population. Prospective, rigorous population studies are warranted to confirm the potential preventive effect of CM. The newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused more than 11,900 laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 259 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health. Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.",2020,,Chinese journal of integrative medicine Emerging microbes & infections,9,1,382-385,32065055,10.1007/s11655-020-3192-6 10.1080/22221751.2020.1729069,13842,#12603,Luo 2020,,"* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Other related diseases and viruses",24-03-20
[Standardized diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer during the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 in Renji hospital],"Luo, Y.; Zhong, M.","Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently raging in China. It has been proven that COVID-19 can be transmitted from human to human and cause hospital infection, which seriously threatens surgical staffs and inpatients. Although colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic, but in this special situation, it is a difficult task to provide the highest quality medical services and ensure the orderly clinical work, on the premise of maximizing the protection for patients and their families, health of medical staff, and the safety of wards and hospitals, We summarize how to carry out the clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemiology, including the procedures of diagnose and treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, and share the experiences of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal cancer who are scheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the perioperative management. More importantly, we introduce in detail the operative management and perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients suspected or diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, including prevention and control measures for medical staff, operating rooms and surgical instruments. The main points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must be run through the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. The members include not only routine departments, but also respiratory department and infectious department. (2) Colonoscopy examination may cause cross infection of COVID-19 to patients and doctors. Therefore, it is prior to examine the emergency cases and life-threatening patients (bleeding, obstruction, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, etc.). If the emergent patients (intestinal obstruction) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, the surgeons must perform emergency surgery, and intestinal decompressive tube through colonoscopy is not recommended. (3) The colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed in the isolated room with separate medical devices, and the operative room with negative pressure (under -5 Pa) must be separated. All disposable medical items, body fluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified disposed according to the medical waste standard. (4) The surgical medical workers who process colorectal cancer patients with COVID-19 must be protected by three-level.

"The impending storm: COVID-19, pandemics and our overwhelmed emergency departments","Mareiniss, Darren P.","Previously, I have written about the national crisis in emergency care [1]. As many of us know, emergency departments (EDs) are being overwhelmed by untenable patient volumes and care requirements. As my prior article titled “A Brewing Storm: Our Overwhelmed Emergency Departments” noted, this problem has been well known for many years and, yet, generally ignored by the lay press and public [1]. In 2006, fourteen years ago, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) warned of this in a report titled “Hospital-Based Emergency Care: At the Breaking Point.” In that report, the IOM noted that EDs were already overwhelmed and that our patient visits per year were significantly increasing [2]. The report stated that patient visits from 1993 to 2003 had grown from 90.3 million per year to 113.9 million per year [2]. Also, the number of EDs had actually decreased and the patients being seen were reportedly sicker [2]. Disaster preparedness was a significant concern and the report noted that most city hospitals were operating at or near capacity and even a multiple car crash would create havoc in most of these EDs [2]. In the years since that report, our volumes have continued to climb. In 2017, a National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care survey reported ED patient visits reached over 138 million in that year [3]. That was a 21% increase from 113.9 million visits in 2003 and an average annual growth of 1.7% per year. That number represents 42.8% of the entire U.S. population of 329 million [4]. These high volumes and the resulting crowding in the ED do and continue to compromise care. Of note, prior studies have shown that ED crowding is linked to increased patient mortality, decreased patient satisfaction and treatment delays [[5], [6], [7]]. In addition to the daily crowding issues, U.S. disaster preparedness is currently in poor condition. The ED is the frontline medical response to any disaster and, yet, it is already stretched to its limit. Currently, one of the federal government's strategies to deal with a potentially overwhelming catastrophic disaster that outstrips resources is to engage in “crisis standards of care” [8,9]. That is, if overwhelmed, the federal government has advised states to create guidelines for hospitals to allocate scarce resources to save the greatest number of lives [8,9]. Such strategies are to be utilized in only the most dire of situations (e.g., severe pandemic, catastrophic event) in which medical resources are completely outstripped. Our current problem with ED volumes predisposes the system to cross this threshold during a disaster.[truncated]",2020,,The American Journal of Emergency Medicine,,,,,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.033,12501,#11792,Mareiniss 2020,,"* Opinion piece; Ethics, social science, economics",24-03-20

Most often at the origin of a mild infectious syndrome, associating mild symptoms (fever, cough, myalgia, headache and possible digestive disorders) to different degrees, SARS-Covid-2 can cause serious pulmonary pathologies and sometimes death.Data on the consequences during pregnancy are limited. The first Chinese data published seem to show that the symptoms in pregnant women are the same as those of the general population. There are no cases of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission, but cases of newborns infected early suggest that there could be vertical perpartum or neonatal transmission. Induced prematurity and cases of respiratory distress in newborns of infected mothers have been described.Pregnancy is known as a period at higher risk for the consequences of respiratory infections, as for influenza, so it seems important to screen for Covid-19 in the presence of symptoms and to monitor closely pregnant women.In this context of the SARS-Covid-2 epidemic, the societies of gynecology-obstetrics, infectious diseases and neonatalogy have proposed a French protocol for the management of possible and proven cases of SARS-Covid-2 in pregnant women.

Evolutionary Trajectory for the Emergence of Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,"Rehman, Saif ur; Shafique, Laiba; Ihsan, Awais; Liu, Qingyou","Over the last two decades, the world experienced three outbreaks of coronaviruses with elevated morbidity rates. Currently, the global community is facing emerging virus SARS-CoV-2 belonging to Betacoronavirus, which appears to be more transmissible but less deadly than SARS-CoV. The current study aimed to track the evolutionary ancestors and different evolutionary strategies that were genetically adapted by SARS-CoV-2. Our whole-genome analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was the descendant of Bat SARS/SARS-like CoVs and bats served as a natural reservoir. SARS-CoV-2 used mutations and recombination as crucial strategies in different genomic regions including the envelop, membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike glycoproteins to become a novel infectious agent. We confirmed that mutations in different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 have specific influence on virus reproductive adaptability, allowing for genotype adjustment and adaptations in rapidly changing environments. Moreover, for the first time we identified nine putative recombination patterns in SARS-CoV-2, which encompass spike glycoprotein, RdRp, helicase and ORF3a. Six recombination regions were spotted in the S gene and are undoubtedly important for evolutionary survival, meanwhile this permitted the virus to modify superficial antigenicity to find a way from immune reconnaissance in animals and adapt to a human host. With these combined natural selected strategies, SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a novel virus in human society.",2020,,"Pathogens 2020, Vol. 9, Page 240",9,3,240-240,,10.3390/PATHOGENS9030240,12444,#11983,Rehman 2020,,"Reservoir; Virology, immunology",24-03-20
An update on COVID-19 for the radiologist - A British society of Thoracic Imaging statement,"Rodrigues, J. C. L.; Hare, S. S.; Edey, A.; Devaraj, A.; Jacob, J.; Johnstone, A.; McStay, R.; Nair, A.; Robinson, G.","In December 2019, Wuhan City (Hubei Province, China) reported a febrile respiratory tract illness of unknown origin in a cluster of patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage of the patients isolated a novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]) as the pathogen.1 The pulmonary infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of 14 March 2020, the WHO reported 142,651 worldwide cases with 5,393 deaths.2 Despite the imposition of strict quarantine rules and restricted travel within and from China, the infection has spread rapidly affecting countries worldwide. It continues to escalate. As of 14 March 2020, 797 UK cases have been confirmed, with 10 deaths.3 Testing currently involves a laboratory test from swab samples obtained from the respiratory tract (most commonly a single nose and throat swab). The WHO currently classifies cases into three potential categories: (1) suspected, (2) probable, and (3) confirmed. Suspected cases are primarily those with a febrile respiratory illness and history of travel to a country or region reporting local transmission of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset. In the past few weeks, changes to diagnostic criteria (using imaging as an adjunct to real-time transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) has led to an increase in reported cases. Clinical presentation of COVID-19 The majority of patients present with a lower respiratory tract infection comprising fever, cough, dyspnoea, and myalgia. Although most patients have a mild illness, 17–29% of patients are reported to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).4,5 Mortality rates are estimated at 3.6%.6 An elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lymphopenia (<1,100 μ/L) are characteristic7 Radiology departments should be prepared for an increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 and new diagnoses or risk stratification may be imaging based. As such, it is important for radiologists to be familiar with the potential spectrum of imaging findings, as well as set out protocols to limit contamination and spread. Chest imaging findings in COVID-19 Initial findings Initial imaging with chest radiograph (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) may be normal in COVID-19. Disease severity and timing of imaging appear to impact on the rates of normal baseline imaging. In non-severe disease, up to 18% of patients have a normal initial CXR or CT, but only 3% in severe disease.8 In a series of 121 symptomatic patients, a normal CT was found in 56% of patients scanned within 2 days of symptom onset, whereas normal scans were observed in only 9% and 4% of patients if imaged 3–5 days or 6–12 days from symptoms, respectively.9 Therefore, radiographic abnormalities are almost certain to be present on CT following 6 days of symptoms. Furthermore, Shi et al. have reported radiological abnormality, predominantly ground-glass opacity (GGO), in subclinical disease, where 15 patients were imaged using CT before symptom onset.10 As such, the precise time when imaging becomes abnormal is heterogeneous and the disease should not be excluded based on a normal CT examination acquired early after symptom onset. When imaging is abnormal, there are some common features. CXR typically shows patchy or diffuse asymmetric airspace opacities, similar to other causes of coronavirus pneumonias.4 The most common initial CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia are bilateral, subpleural GGO, ill-defined margins, and a slight right lower lobe predilection10; however, the initial imaging findings are not organism specific and can overlap with H1N1 influenza, cytomegalovirus pneumonia, and other atypical pneumonias11 Temporal evolution of findings With increased time between symptom onset and imaging, the pattern of radiological findings progresses from focal unilateral abnormality to diffuse bilateral opacities with evolution to consolidation, reticulation, and mixed-pattern disease involving more lung segments.10 The pattern of CT disease may have prognostic implications, with consolidation being reported in nearly all patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) support and GGO in those not requiring ICU.5 “Crazy-paving” pattern and the “atoll” sign is also reported with greater time from symptom onset.9 In a cohort of 21 patients with COVID-19 who recovered, late-stage CT findings (14 days or longer) showed varying degrees of clearing but signs may persist for more than 1 month after initial detection.12 Uncommon imaging findings Imaging features that are only rarely encountered include pneumothorax, cavitation, or lymphadenopathy.13 Features such as pleural effusion, extensive tiny lung nodules, tree in bud, and lymphadenopathy may well suggest bacterial superinfection or an alternative diagnosis.14",2020,,Clinical Radiology,,,,,10.1016/j.crad.2020.03.003,12492,#11985,Rodrigues 2020,,"* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment",24-03-20

However even such settings are not prepared to deal with the situation, and lessons are only slowly being learnt. There is still an urgent need to accelerate protocols that lead to the implementation of rapid point-of-care diagnostic testing and effective antiviral therapies. In some high-risk populations, such as dialysis patients, where several individuals are treated at the same time in a limited space and overcrowded areas, our objective must be to ensure protection to patients, the healthcare team and the dialysis ward.

Can the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Affect the Eyes? A Review of Coronaviruses and Ocular Implications in Humans and Animals COVID-19 in the Shadows of MERS-CoV in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"Seah, I.; Agrawal, R.; Barry, M.; Al Amri, M.; Memish, Z. A.","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (CoV) epidemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from China. This virus causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since then, there have been anecdotal reports of ocular infection. The ocular implications of human CoV infections have not been widely studied. However, CoVs have been known to cause various ocular infections in animals. Clinical entities such as conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis have been documented in feline and murine models. In this article, the current evidence suggesting possible human CoV infection of ocular tissue is reviewed. The review article will also highlight animal CoVs and their associated ocular infections. We hope that this article will serve as a start for further research into the ocular implications of human CoV infections. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has plagued the Middle East since it was first reported in 2012. Recently, at the end of December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases were reported from Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, linked to a wet seafood market with a new coronavirus identified as the etiologic agent currently named SARS-CoV-2. Most cases are in Mainland China with international spread to 25 countries. The novelty of the virus, the rapid national and international spread, and the lack of therapeutic and preventative strategies have led the WHO International Health Regulation emergency committee to declare the disease as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. As it relates to countries with the ongoing MERS-CoV community cases and hospital acquired infections, there will be a huge challenge for HCWs to deal with both coronaviruses, especially with the lack of standardized and approved point of care testing. This challenge will now be faced by the whole global health community dealing with COVID-19 since both coronaviruses have similar presentation. Those patients should now be tested for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, and with the continuing wide international spread of SARS-CoV-2, the travel history to China in the last 14 days will be of less significance.",2020,,Ocular immunology and inflammation Journal of epidemiology and global health,10,1,01-May,32175703,10.1080/09273948.2020.1738501 10.2991/jegh.k.200218.003,14241,#13024,Seah 2020,,"* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Other related diseases and viruses",24-03-20
Covid-19: Protecting Worker Health,"Semple, Sean; Cherrie, John W.","At the time of writing (5 March 2020) Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) has spread to 76 countries with over 93 000 cases (WHO, 2020a) around the world since it was first identified and described in China on 31 December 2019 (WHO, 2020b). The case fatality rate may be as high as 3.4% and, although the indications are that it is a mild, self-limiting illness for the majority of those infected, it clearly has the potential to cause significant disruption globally. Many countries are moving from the ‘containment’ to the ‘delay’ phase in controlling the outbreak with a recent UK model suggesting a potential peak in June 2020 (Danon et al., 2020). Occupational hygienists have particular skills in understanding exposure to hazards in the workplace and a long history of introducing simple and effective measures that reduce risk to workers’ health. These skills may be able to contribute to protecting the global workforce from Covid-19. Workers involved in healthcare have always had a recognized increase in risk of developing infections present in the community where their patients are drawn. Health care workers are often on the front line dealing with those who are ill and at the most infectious period of a disease, as in the cases of SARS, MERS, and Ebola. Healthcare facilities can therefore act as a focus for infection spreading, giving rise to disease clusters linked to hospitals, social care facilities, and other health locations (Rajakaruna et al., 2017). In the SARS and MERS outbreaks between 2003 and 2015, between 44 and 100% of cases were linked to healthcare settings and healthcare workers made up around a quarter of those infected (Chowell et al., 2015). Other workers involved in providing services to the public may also be at increased risk during particular outbreaks where transmission is through face-to-face or close contact. A recent analysis in the USA has estimated that 10% of the workforce are employed in roles where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week (Baker et al., 2020). Beyond caring and protective service workers, there are a wide range of service-economy workers who may be at risk from a respiratory infection like Covid-19. Shop workers, bus drivers, cleaners, teachers, bank workers and hospitality staff are among the many service-sector employees who will have frequent and close interaction with many people over the course of a shift. Many of these workers will either have physical contact with the public or indirect contact through exchange of money or goods—an exposure route for transmission that is poorly understood (Angelakis et al., 2014). There are also complex societal issues around workers who are ill but feel that they have to work for economic or other reasons, and thereby increase the risks for colleagues and the public.[truncated]",2020,,Annals of Work Exposures and Health,,,,,10.1093/annweh/wxaa033,12450,#11987,Semple 2020,,* Narrative review; * Opinion piece; Infection prevention and control,24-03-20

The imaging findings, clinical data, and laboratory data were evaluated.ResultsFifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of contact with individuals from the endemic center in Wuhan, China. Fever (49 of 51, 96%) and cough (24 of 51, 47%) were the most common symptoms. Most patients had a normal white blood cell count (37 of 51, 73%), neutrophil count (44 of 51, 86%), and either normal (17 of 51, 35%) or reduced (33 of 51, 65%) lymphocyte count. CT images showed pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 39 of 51 (77%) patients and GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38 of 51 (75%) patients. GGO with consolidation was present in 30 of 51 (59%) patients, and pure consolidation was present in 28 of 51 (55%) patients. Forty-four of 51 (86%) patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41 of 51 (80%) involved the posterior part of the lungs and 44 of 51 (86%) were peripheral. There were more consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 days or more from disease onset to CT scan versus 4 days or fewer (431 of 712 lesions vs 129 of 612 lesions; P < .001). Patients older than 50 years had more consolidated lung lesions than did those aged 50 years or younger (212 of 470 vs 198 of 854; P < .001).

Antiviral Action of Tryptanthrin Isolated from Strobilanthes cusia Leaf against Human Coronavirus NL63,"Tsai, Y. C.; Lee, C. L.; Yen, H. R.; Chang, Y. S.; Lin, Y. P.; Huang, S. H.; Lin, C. W.","Strobilanthes cusia (Nees) Kuntze is a Chinese herbal medicine used in the treatment of respiratory virus infections. The methanol extract of S. cusia leaf contains chemical components such as β-sitosterol, indirubin, tryptanthrin, betulin, indigodole A, and indigodole B that have diverse biological activities. However, the antiviral action of S. cusia leaf and its components against human coronavirus remains to be elucidated. Human coronavirus NL63 infection is frequent among immunocompromised individuals, young children, and in the elderly. This study investigated the anti-Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) activity of the methanol extract of S. cusia leaf and its major components. The methanol extract of S. cusia leaf effectively inhibited the cytopathic effect (CPE) and virus yield (IC(50) = 0.64 μg/mL) in HCoV-NL63-infected cells. Moreover, this extract potently inhibited the HCoV-NL63 infection in a concentration-dependent manner. Among the six components identified in the methanol extract of S. cusia leaf, tryptanthrin and indigodole B (5aR-ethyltryptanthrin) exhibited potent antiviral activity in reducing the CPE and progeny virus production. The IC(50) values against virus yield were 1.52 μM and 2.60 μM for tryptanthrin and indigodole B, respectively. Different modes of time-of-addition/removal assay indicated that tryptanthrin prevented the early and late stages of HCoV-NL63 replication, particularly by blocking viral RNA genome synthesis and papain-like protease 2 activity.

Receptor Recognition by the Novel Coronavirus from Wuhan: an Analysis Based on Decade-Long Structural Studies of SARS Coronavirus,"Wan, Y.; Shang, J.; Graham, R.; Baric, R. S.; Li, F.","Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged from Wuhan, China, causing symptoms in humans similar to those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Since the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive structural analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between the SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. Here, we analyzed the potential receptor usage by 2019-nCoV, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the newly released sequence of 2019-nCoV. First, the sequence of 2019-nCoV RBD, including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2, is similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor. Second, several critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Gln493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with 2019-nCoV's capacity for human cell infection. Third, several other critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but not ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV has acquired some capacity for human-to-human transmission. Last, while phylogenetic analysis indicates a bat origin of 2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a diversity of animal species (except mice and rats), implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV infections. These analyses provide insights into the receptor usage, cell entry, host cell infectivity and animal origin of 2019-nCoV and may help epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against 2019-nCoV.IMPORTANCE The recent emergence of Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) puts the world on alert. 2019-nCoV is reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses. Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV. This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic, translational, and public health research communities with predictive insights that may help study and battle this novel 2019-nCoV.",2020,,Journal of virology,94,7,,31996437,10.1128/jvi.00127-20,13868,#13107,Wan 2020,,"Reservoir; Virology, immunology",24-03-20

Betrachtung der Pandemie Phase 3 – „mitigation“ – vom Endpunkt Hospitalisation her,"Weigl, Josef","Die Phase 3 – „mitigation“ – der jetzigen Pandemie durch das SARS-CoV‑2 steht nun auch in Deutschland unmittelbar bevor. Da es aufgrund der hohen Komplexität sehr viel zu beachten gibt, ist Vereinfachung dringend geboten, nicht zuletzt auch, um den Fokus auf die wichtigen Dinge nicht aus den Augen zu verlieren. Die Phase 3 vom Endpunkt, und zwar der stationären Behandlung (Hospitalisation), her zu betrachten, soll den Blick auf die Einflussgrößen flussaufwärts schärfen. Auf der Grundlage einer simplifizierten Modellierung mit Hilfe von angenäherten und plausiblen Parametern für die Infektionsrate (attack rate), hier als AR(gesamt) bezeichnet, die Rate für eine stationäre Aufnahme – AR(stationär) und die Rate für eine intensivmedizinische Behandlung – AR(intensiv), werden als SOLL mit den verfügbaren Ressourcen, sprich Betten im allgemeinstationären und intensivmedizinischen Bereich, IST, verglichen. Die Berechnungen werden populations-bezogen je für den Landkreis Plön und die Metropolregion Kiel zusammen mit Kreis Plön ausgeführt. Da in den bisherigen Kohorten die Prozentsätze der notwendigen Maßnahmen überschätzt werden, sollte eine deutlich niedrigere AR(stationär) und AR(intensiv) zu erwarten sein. Eine AR(stationär) von 10 % wäre für den Flächenkreis Plön nicht abzubilden, eine mit 5 % sehr wohl. In der regionalen Betrachtung mit dem Universitätsklinikum SH, Standort Kiel, lässt sich sogar eine AR(stationär) von bis zu 10 % abbilden, insbesondere auch eine AR(intensiv) von 3 %. Allerdings ist die Anflutungsgeschwindigkeit von den epidemiologischen Gegenmaßnahmen und dem Einweisungsverhalten abhängig. Die verfügbare Bettenanzahl wird von der freigemachten Bettenzahl und der Liegedauer bestimmt; letztere von Alter und Vorerkrankungen der Patienten. Ein Systemversagen sollte durch Klarheit über die entscheidenden Parameter und ihrer Einflussgrößen vermieden werden. Die regionale Betrachtung der Versorgung ist wichtig und sollte von einem Bettenkoordinator gesteuert werden.

Topological dynamics of the 2015 South Korea MERS-CoV spread-on-contact networks,"Yang, C. H.; Jung, H.","Network analysis to examine infectious contact relations provides an important means to uncover the topologies of individual infectious contact networks. This study aims to investigate the spread of diseases among individuals over contact networks by exploring the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in Korea. We present several distinct features of MERS transmission by employing a comprehensive approach in network research to examine both the traced relationship matrix of infected individuals and their bipartite transmission routes among healthcare facilities visited for treatment. The results indicate that a few super-spreaders were more likely to hold certain structural advantages by linking to an exceptional number of other individuals, causing several ongoing transmission events in neighbourhoods without the aid of any intermediary. Thus, the infectious contact network exhibited small-world dynamics characterised by locally clustered contacts exposed to transmission paths via short path lengths. In addition, nosocomial infection analysis shows the pattern of a common-source outbreak followed by secondary person-to-person transmission of the disease. Based on the results, we suggest policy implications related to the redesign of prevention and control strategies against the spread of epidemics.",2020,,Scientific reports,10,1,4327,32152361,10.1038/s41598-020-61133-9,14273,#13346,Yang 2020,,* Epidemiological study; Other related diseases and viruses,24-03-20

The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has become a pandemic with tens of thousands of infected patients. Based on clinical features, pathology, the pathogenesis of acute respiratory disorder induced by either highly homogenous coronaviruses or other pathogens, the evidence suggests that excessive inflammation, oxidation, and an exaggerated immune response very likely contribute to COVID-19 pathology. This leads to a cytokine storm and subsequent progression to acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and often death. Melatonin, a well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecule, is protective against ALI/ARDS caused by viral and other pathogens. Melatonin is effective in critical care patients by reducing vessel permeability, anxiety, sedation use, and improving sleeping quality, which might also be beneficial for better clinical outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Notably, melatonin has a high safety profile. There is significant data showing that melatonin limits virus-related diseases and would also likely be beneficial in COVID-19 patients.

The Role of Telehealth in Reducing the Mental Health Burden from COVID-19,"Zhou, Xiaoyun; Snoswell, Centaine L.; Harding, Louise E.; Bambling, Matthew; Edirippulige, Sisira; Bai, Xuejun; Smith, Anthony C.","The psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic must be recognized alongside the physical symptoms for all those affected.1,2 Telehealth, or more specifically telemental health services, are practically feasible and appropriate for the support of patients, family members, and health service providers during this pandemic.3 As of March 18, 2020, there were >198,000 COVID-19 infections recorded globally, and 7,900 deaths. Psychological symptoms relating to COVID-19 have already been observed on a population level including anxiety-driven panic buying4 and paranoia about attending community events. Students, workers, and tourists who have been prevented from accessing their training institutions, workplaces, homes, respectively, are expected to have developed psychological symptoms due to stress and reduced autonomy and concerns about income, job, security, and so on.5 The Chinese, Singaporean, and Australian governments have highlighted the psychological side effects of COVID-19, and have voiced concerns regarding the long-term impacts of isolation and that the fear and panic in the community could cause more harm than COVID-19.6–8 In the absence of a medical cure for COVID-19, the global response is a simple public health strategy of isolation for those infected or at risk, reduced social contact to slow the spread of the virus, and simple hygiene such as hand washing to reduce the risk of infection. While the primary intervention of isolation may well achieve its goals, it leads to reduced access to support from family and friends, and degrades normal social support systems and causes loneliness, and is a risk for worsening anxiety and depressive symptoms.9 If left untreated, these psychological symptoms may have long-term health effects on patients and require treatment adding to the cost burden of managing the illness. Clinical and nonclinical staff are also at risk of psychological distress as they are expected to work longer hours with a high risk of exposure to the virus. This may also lead to stress, anxiety, burnout, depressive symptoms, and the need for sick or stress leave, which would have a negative impact on the capacity of the health system to provide services during the crisis.10 Treatment protocols for people with COVID-19 should address both the physiological and psychological needs of the patients and health service providers. Providing psychological treatment and support may reduce the burden of comorbid mental health conditions and ensure the wellbeing of those affected. Our challenge is to provide mental health services in the context of patient isolation, which highlights the role of telehealth (through videoconference, e-mail, telephone, or smartphone apps). The provision of mental health support (especially through telehealth) will likely help patients maintain psychological well-being and cope with acute and postacute health requirements more favorably. Examples of and evidence to support the effectiveness of telemental health are fairly diverse, especially in the context of depression,11 anxiety,12 and PTSD.13 Videoconferencing,14 online forums,15 smartphone apps,16 text-messaging,15 and e-mails17 have been shown to be useful communication methods for the delivery of mental health services. China is actively providing various telemental health services during the outbreak of COVID-19. These services are from government and academic agencies and include counseling, supervision, training, as well as psychoeducation through online platforms (e.g., hotline, WeChat, and Tencent QQ).18,19 Telemental health services have been prioritized for people at higher risk of exposure to COVID-19, including clinicians on the frontline, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and their families, policemen, and security guards. Early reports also showed how people in isolation actively sought online support to address mental health needs, which demonstrated both a population interest and acceptance of this medium.20 Additional telehealth services have been previously funded by the Aust alian Government (Better Access Initiative program), to address mental health needs of rural and remote patients during emergency situations,21 such as long-term drought and bushfires.
